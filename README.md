EstimationForloop
This code is to estimate pi value using monte carlo estimation. 
It estimates pi with the points of count in 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, and 10^7. 
It returns three plots: estimation of pi, deviation of pi, and computational cost.

EstimationWhileloop
This code is to estimate pi value within specific level of precision, using while loop.
It records the estimated value of pi, the number of iterations, and computational cost. 

PiEstimate
This is a MATLAB function to estimate pi with specific precision level as a user input.
It also returns the plot of estimation, green spots inside the circle and red spots outside the circle.
It returns estimation of pi, the number of points used, execution time, and precision level.
